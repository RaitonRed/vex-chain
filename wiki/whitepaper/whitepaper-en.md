# VEX chain Whitepaper

## Abstract
VEX is a next-generation blockchain platform implementing a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with native smart contract functionality. Designed for high scalability and energy efficiency, VEX combines advanced cryptographic techniques with a robust network architecture to create a sustainable ecosystem for decentralized applications. The platform features a native cryptocurrency (VEX) with a fixed supply of 20 million tokens, distributed through a fair initial allocation model.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem
Current blockchain networks face significant challenges including:
- High energy consumption with Proof-of-Work systems
- Scalability limitations and network congestion
- Complex user experiences for developers and end-users
- Inefficient consensus mechanisms that limit participation

### 1.2 The VEX Solution
VEX addresses these challenges through:
- Energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake consensus
- Modular architecture supporting smart contracts and custom transactions
- Simplified developer APIs and comprehensive documentation
- Native token economy with strategic distribution model

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Network Overview
VEX implements a multi-layer architecture:

**Consensus Layer**: Proof-of-Stake with validator selection based on stake weight
**Network Layer**: P2P networking with efficient block propagation
**Application Layer**: Smart contract execution and transaction processing
**API Layer**: RESTful interfaces for external interaction

### 2.2 Consensus Mechanism
VEX utilizes a novel Proof-of-Stake implementation with the following characteristics:

- **Validator Selection**: Weighted random selection based on staked amount
- **Block Finality**: Immediate finality through digital signatures
- **Reward Distribution**: Block rewards and transaction fees distributed to validators
- **Slashing Conditions**: Penalties for malicious behavior (5% slash rate)

### 2.3 Cryptographic Foundation
- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA with secp256k1 curve for transaction signing
- **Address Generation**: Blake2b hashing of public keys (20-byte addresses)
- **Key Management**: Encrypted wallet storage with password-derived keys
- **Message Verification**: Signature verification for all network communications

## 3. Native Token (VEX)

### 3.1 Tokenomics
- **Total Supply**: 20,000,000 VEX (fixed supply)
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Block Reward**: 50 VEX per block (subject to governance)
- **Initial Distribution**:
  - Foundation: 20% (4,000,000 VEX)
  - Ecosystem Development: 30% (6,000,000 VEX)
  - Public Sale: 50% (10,000,000 VEX)

### 3.2 Token Utility
VEX serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:
- **Staking**: Required for validator participation
- **Transaction Fees**: Payment for network operations
- **Governance**: Voting rights for protocol upgrades
- **Smart Contract Execution**: Payment for computational resources

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 Blockchain Implementation
The VEX blockchain features:
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, transactions, validator, signature
- **Block Time**: Configurable block interval (default: variable based on network conditions)
- **Transaction Processing**: Parallel transaction validation
- **State Management**: UTXO-like model with account balances

### 4.2 Smart Contract System
- **Virtual Machine**: Custom VM for contract execution
- **Contract Deployment**: Deterministic address generation
- **Event System**: Emittable events with indexed parameters
- **Gas Mechanism**: Transaction-based resource allocation

### 4.3 P2P Network
- **Peer Discovery**: Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- **Message Protocol**: JSON-based messaging with signature verification
- **Block Propagation**: Efficient block broadcasting with compact representation
- **Network Security**: Signature verification for all incoming messages

## 5. Stake Management

### 5.1 Staking Mechanism
- **Minimum Stake**: Configurable minimum stake amount
- **Validator Registration**: Required for block production participation
- **Reward Distribution**: Proportional rewards based on staked amount
- **Unstaking Process**: Timed unlocking period for withdrawn stakes

### 5.2 Validator Economics
- **Block Rewards**: 50 VEX + transaction fees per block
- **Fee Structure**: Transaction fees distributed to validators
- **Slashing Conditions**: Penalty for malicious behavior (5% of stake)
- **Uptime Requirements**: Regular activity needed to maintain validator status

## 6. API Layer
